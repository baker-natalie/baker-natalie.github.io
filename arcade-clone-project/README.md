# Classic Arcade Clone

### Project Description

This is the third project for Udacity's Front-End Developer Nanodegree progrom. Create a frogger-style game using Object Oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. Students are provided with images and a game loop engine, and must build the game from there.

### How to Play

Go to [the live demo](http://baker-natalie.github.io/arcade-clone-project)

Use the arrow keys to move the player across the board. Reaching the water is a win, colliding with a bug is a lose.

I referenced the following project repositories by previous students to help me understand and construct my code.
