        <strong>Who is River Song?</strong> That's a complicated question! River was first introduced to <i>Doctor Who</i> fans in Series 4, Episode 8: Silence in the Library. It was the Doctor's first meeting with River, but it was River's last meeting with the Doctor.

        <p>After her death, we next meet River Song as she escapes from prison and joins the Doctor and his new companion Amelia Pond on a suicide mission to escape the ancient shipwreck of the Byzantium. She is a mysterious figure, but Amy guesses that River will be married to the Doctor in their future and River's past. After a series of prison-breaks and misadventures, River reveals herself to be the long-lost, time-travelling, part-time-lord daughter of Amy Pond and Rory Williams.</p>

        <p>Until Series 6, Episode 13: The Wedding of River Song, only vague hints are dropped about River's imprisonment. We know only that she killed someone important, and it was probably the Doctor. She does indeed shoot him at Lake Silencio in Utah, but it is then revealed that he used a robotic double and still lives.</p>

        <p>River saved the Doctor's life in Series 6, Episode 8: Let's Kill Hitler by giving up the energy for all her remaining regenerations to heal him. They were married after pulling off their scheme at Lake Silencio, and she has travelled with the Doctor on many occasions.</p>
