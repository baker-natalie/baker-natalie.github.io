          <li><strong>River</strong>: Well, I was on my way to this gay Gypsy bar mitzvah for the disabled when I suddenly thought "Gosh, the Third Reich's a bit rubbish. I think I'll kill the Fuehrer." Who's with me? (6X08)</li>
          <li><strong>River</strong>: It's a time machine. I can take it, do whatever I want for as long as I like and pop it back a second later. He'll never know it was gone. (9X13)</li>
          <li><strong>River</strong>: The Doctor's death doesn't frighten me, nor does my own. There's a far worse day coming for me. (6X01)</li>
          <li><strong>River</strong>: Look around you. The starship Harmony And Redemption, minimum ticket price one billion credits, plus the provable murder of multiple innocent life forms. Suites are reserved for planet-burners. (<i>picks up a drink from a passing waiter</i>) Thank you. Even the staff are required to have a verifiable history of indiscriminate slaughter. This is where genocide comes to kick back and relax. Do try the fish. (09X13)</li>
          <li><strong>River</strong>: Funny thing is, this means you've always known how I was going to die. All the time we've been together, you knew I was coming here. The last time I saw you, the real you, the future you, I mean, you turned up on my doorstep, with a new haircut and a suit. You took me to Darillium to see the Singing Towers. What a night that was. The Towers sang, and you cried... You wouldn't tell me why, but I suppose you knew it was time. My time. Time to come to the library. You even gave me your screwdriver. That should have been a clue.
